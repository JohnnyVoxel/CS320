##     How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure? 

Ensuring that software is functional and secure is paramount when it comes to developing in a professional capacity. In previous projects I endeavored to make my finished product fully functional and secure. Previous attempts at testing, however, were rudimentary at best. Using a formal testing methodology allows for much more efficient, rapid, and thorough testing of a program. I plan to incorporate testing as an integral part of my development process in all future projects. 

## How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program? 

A solid understanding of user needs is important to the development of a project. Before coding and testing can begin, there needs to be a plan in place. This plan is derived from the project requirements and user needs. Only after having a detailed layout of what functionality will be required of a feature, including all inputs and outputs, can development begin. Unit testing should be developed directly in relation to these user requirements.

## How do I approach designing software?

My software development process typically begins with a careful analysis of the project requirements. Having a solid understanding of the overall scope and desired outcomes will inform the rest of the process. After that, I break down and detail each component of the project. Even though I am working as a solo developer and the scope of the project is relatively small, I have found that following a modified Agile methodology has worked very well. I attempt to getting a working prototype running as soon as possible and continue to cycle through designing, developing, and testing new features.
